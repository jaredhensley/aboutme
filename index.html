  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p> I'm an average guy with a wide variety of interests.   I'd consider myself to be personable yet reserved.  I'm typically not the life of the party, but I could sit in if needed.

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I was born in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  However, I am sort of a hybrid as I spent much of my youth in the greatest country in the world, New Jersey! I've also dabbled in other areas of the country: mainly Chicago, Illinois and Charleston, South Carolina.</p>

  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
  <p>Learning about new interests. The internet is an amazing place for a curious person.  I've played music off and on throughout the years as well and would like to rededicate myself to playing the drums at some point.</p>
  <h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
  <p>A job where I can build really cool things that people enjoy tinkering with.  Previously, I was on track to start graduate school for physical therapy. I started to realize that I should pursue something that I actually want to do, not what I <i>should</i> do.</p>
  <h3>What's your background?</h3>
  <p>I started coding in turbo pascal back in the early 2000's in a high school coding course.  One of my first memories of coding is writing a book report for my sophomore english class in Turbo Pascal. One of my most used passwords originates from a randomly generated string assigned by Tripod back in the 90s (I may be dating myself here!).  It's not too surprising that I've developed an interest in web development.  I studied cell biology and business at Coastal Carolina University.</p>
